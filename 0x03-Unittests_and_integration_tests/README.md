# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

Alx project to demonstrate how to write unit and integration tests using the python unit testing framework and mock object library.

- Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs.
- Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures
